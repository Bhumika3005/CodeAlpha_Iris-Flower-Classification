This project demonstrates how to classify Iris flowers into one of three species — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica — using machine learning. It is based on the classic Iris dataset introduced by the statistician Ronald Fisher. The dataset includes measurements like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The goal is to build a classification model using Scikit-learn, evaluate its performance, and understand the fundamentals of classification in machine learning.

Objectives :

Load and understand the Iris dataset.

Train a machine learning model to classify flower species.

Evaluate model performance on test data.

Visualize decision boundaries and feature relationships.

Learn core concepts of classification.
